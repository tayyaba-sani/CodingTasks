# CodingTasks
I have added below coding tasks.

1) ThreeSum  
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.  
Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.  
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]  
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]  

2) Pascal's triangle  
Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.  
In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:  
Input: numRows = 5  
Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]  

3) Rotate Image  
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).  
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.  
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]  
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]  

4) FourSum
Given an array nums of n integers, return an array of all the unique quadruplets [nums[a], nums[b], nums[c], nums[d]] such that:  
0 <= a, b, c, d < n  
a, b, c, and d are distinct.  
nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target  
You may return the answer in any order.  
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], target = 8  
Output: [[2,2,2,2]]
